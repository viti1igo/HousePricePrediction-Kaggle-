HousePrediction-Kaggle-
25 07 24

Hello, this is Axel, studying at the University of Technology Sydney. This is my first model (Linear Regression) predicting the House Price, the dataset is on Kaggle. Because there is no accurate way to evaluate the model on their test.csv file as it doesn't have the true SalePrice or the accuracy of the model, I will use only the train.csv file to train and test the model. The approach of this model is choosing some features (cols) as the X, including 'BldgType', 'MSZoning', 'Street', 'LotShape', 'PropertyAge', 'GrLivArea', 'YrSold' (description in the data_description.txt file).

From this project, I have had the opportunity to practice deploying a simple Linear Regression model although the data has not been cleaned as there are many loopholes in the dataset (null values, outliers, etc.).
